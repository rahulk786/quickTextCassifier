Text classification is a simple task. However writing code for a text classifier is not that simple, it takes a lot of time and effort QuickText aims to save that time and effort by providing Utilities to process the training dataset Utilities to vectorize input text using pre-trained word vectors Text classification models Trainer to train the models Why sPacy sPacy is an extremely fast and scalable NLP library. sPacy is a core part of this framework. Their rich API allows us to create components for tokenizing text or getting word embeddings that speeds up the process of training. Moreover sPacy has support for 59+ languages, hence this multiple language support can also be utilized in QuickText Goals These are our goals for the alpha release Provide support for multiple sPacy models Provide several sequence classification models Provide onnx support for classification models Add support for other pre-trained word-vectors","title":"Home"},{"location":"#quicktext","text":"Hey there, welcome to QuickText This project is still under development, docs will be updated soon All contributions are welcome If you want to contribute, send a mail to s.ramaneswaran2018@vitstudent.ac.in","title":"QuickText"},{"location":"#why-quicktext","text":"Text classification is a simple task.
